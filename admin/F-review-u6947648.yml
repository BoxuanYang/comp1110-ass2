comments:
  -What are the best features of the code?
  -The purpose of each line of code is clear and easy to read
  -Is the code well-documented?
  -The code is well commented. Line 112 could use a bit more commenting.
  -Is the program decomposition appropriate?
  -Yes, but maybe could be defined as a private method since it is only needed for that class
  -Does it follow Java code conventions and is the style consistent throughout?
  -Yes. Some class variables could be created, for example for width and height in line 125 and line 128. Style is consistent.
