  - The best feature of this code is that it achives a specific function
  - using different classes. The code is not well-documented, it does not have enough
  - annotation. The class does a simple job so I think the decomposition is fine. This
  - class follows the java convention beacuse the naming of variables
  - and methods are self-explanatory. I did not find any potential error.
