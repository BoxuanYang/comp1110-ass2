  - The method is good, and works. 
  It has good comments to tell the reader what is happening with the code 
  It is relevant to the program, as it determines if the piece is on the board which is esstential for the Task 7.
  To reduce the length of the if statements, the variables that are used can be intialised earlier for example MARGIN_Y + SQUARE_SIZE is used a couple of times, the variable can be intialised earlier
 Besides the variable naming, it is efficent (use of !before instead of =!)
